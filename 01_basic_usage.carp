carp_simulation:
    dry run
    set mesh units to be mm
    set mesh size 1 x 0.1 x 0.02
    set mesh resolution 100 x 100 x 100
    create mesh called "block" in folder "meshes"
    stimulate mesh for 15 ms with 250 mA for region of size (100, 1100, 300) at (-5050, -550, -150)
    run bidomain simulation for 25 ms with output to "output"
