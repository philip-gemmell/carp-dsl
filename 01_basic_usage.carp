carp_simulation:
    set mesh units to be mm
    set mesh size 10 x 1 x 0.2
    set mesh resolution 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1
    // set mesh centre at (0, 0, 0)
    create mesh called "01_block" in folder "meshes"

    use input file "01_basic.par"
    stimulate mesh at 0 ms for 15 ms with 20 pA/pF for region at (-5.05, -0.55, -0.15) mm of size (0.1, 1.1, 0.3) mm
    run bidomain simulation for 20 ms with output to "output"
