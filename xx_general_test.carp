carp_simulation:
    //dry run
    set mesh size (10 x 1 x 0.2) mm
    set mesh resolution (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1) mm
    set mesh centre at (0, 0, 0) mm
    create mesh called "01_block" in folder "meshes"

    use input file "01_basic.par"
    define region "ventricle" using tag 1
    define region "stimulus" at (-5.0, -0.5, -0.1) mm of size (0.1, 1.1, 0.3) mm
    stimulate mesh at 0 ms for 15 ms with 20 pA/pF for region "stimulus"
    stimulate mesh at 10 ms every 20 ms for 10 ms with 30 pA/pF for region at (-5.05, -0.55, -0.15) mm of size (0.1, 1.1, 0.3) mm
    run bidomain simulation for 20 ms with output to "output"
